WH30K_RPG Project Status - Technical Brief
----------------------------------------

Completed Features (Ticket WH-001):
1. Basic Character Creation System
   - Background selection system
   - Name input
   - Player class implementation with stats
   - Text-based UI for character creation

2. Core Systems:
   - ResourceManager (Singleton pattern)
     * Text resource loading and caching
     * Background description handling
   - Basic game loop
   - Command processing skeleton

Implemented Classes:
1. Player
   - Stats: health, sanity
   - Background system
   - Name handling
   - Constructor overloading implemented

2. Game
   - Main game loop
   - Character creation flow
   - Basic command processing

3. ResourceManager
   - Singleton implementation
   - File loading and caching
   - Error handling

4. Background (enum class)
   - Defined character backgrounds
   - Type-safe enumeration

C++ Concepts Covered:
- Header guards (#pragma once)
- Constructor overloading
- Initialization lists
- Singleton pattern
- File I/O operations
- String handling
- Enum classes
- Exception handling
- Header/Implementation separation
- STL containers (std::map)
- Reference parameters
- Constant member functions

Project Structure:
- Organized source files in logical folders
- Separated resource files from source code
- Proper header/implementation file separation

Next Steps Priority:
1. Development Environment Setup
   - Set up Git repository
   - Configure Jira project
   - Create initial tickets including:
     * Retrospective ticket for completed work
     * Infrastructure setup tickets
     * Next feature tickets

2. Planned Feature Tickets:
   - Implement complete character stats system
   - Add location navigation
   - Expand command processing system
   - Add inventory system
   - Implement save/load functionality

Technical Decisions Made:
1. Using singleton pattern for ResourceManager
2. Text resources stored in separate files
3. Background system using enum class for type safety
4. Constructor overloading for flexible object creation
5. Exception handling for resource loading

Learning Focus:
- Modern C++ practices
- Object-oriented design
- Memory management
- STL usage
- Code organization
